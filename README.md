# Mandelbulb Generator

This project is a Mandelbulb generator implemented in JavaScript and Python. Seven different Mandelbulb instances are rendered in a Flask app, each receiving live weather data from the OpenWeather API. Each instance represents a mushroom that grows dynamically based on live data to its intended size and lifespan, then decays and regrows, repeating the cycle.
